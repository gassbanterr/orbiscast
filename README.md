**OrbisCast** is a Discord bot that streams IPTV channels. It can be controlled by users with [commands](#commands) specified at the end of this document.

The bot was made to simplify watch parties with friends. It is also useful for testing IPTV channels without the need for a dedicated IPTV player.

This project is still in development, so expect bugs and missing features. If you find any issues, please report them in the [Issues](https://github.com/zbejas/orbiscast/issues) section.

> [!CAUTION]
> I am not responsible for any misuse of this tool. Ensure to comply with all applicable copyright laws and obtain necessary permissions for the IPTV content being streamed.
>
> _Using self-bots is against [Discord's terms of service](https://discord.com/guidelines) and may result in account termination. Use at your own risk._

## Installation

### Before you start

You will need to set a few things up before you can run the bot:

- Create a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and get the bot token, and invite the bot to your server.
  - You can follow the instructions [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) to create a bot and get the token and invite link. Make sure to give the bot the necessary permissions:
    - `bot`
    - `applications.commands`
    - In the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), go to your bot's settings and enable the `Message Content Intent`.
- Get the user token from the Discord web client.
  - The user token is required to join the voice channel and stream video. It is recommended to use a secondary account for this purpose.
    - The user has to manually join the server.
  - You can get the token by checking this [gist](https://gist.github.com/MarvNC/e601f3603df22f36ebd3102c501116c6#file-get-discord-token-from-browser-md) I found, or by using a tool like [Discord Get User Token](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/discord-get-user-token/accgjfooejbpdchkfpngkjjdekkcbnfd).
  - **Note**: Be careful when using any third-party tools to get your user token, as they may be malicious. I recommend using the method in the gist.
- Create a `.env` file in the project directory and fill in the required environment variables (see below). You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a template.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not share any of the tokens mentioned above with anyone. If you do, regenerate them immediately by:
>
> - Regenerating the bot token in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
> - Regenerating the user token by logging out and back in to Discord.
>   - If you used incognito mode to get the token, you can go to Discord Settings > Devices > Log out of all known devices (or just log out of the specific session).

### Docker

In the repo is a provided `compose.yml` file that can be used to run the bot.
Copy the file and fill in the required environment variables or create a `.env` file in the same directory as the `compose.yml` file.

Then, run the following command to start the bot:

```bash
docker compose up
```

or to run it in the background:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> You can check the logs using:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose logs -f
> ```
>
> _The `-f` flag is optional and is used to follow the logs._

All of the app data is stored in `/app/data`. The cache is stored in `/app/cache` or RAM, depending on the `RAM_CACHE` and `CACHE_DIR` environment variables.

You can check the available tags on the [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/zbejas/orbiscast/tags?ordering=name).

### Manual

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following instructions are for running the bot manually. If you are using Docker, you can skip this section. [Bun](https://bun.sh/) is required, so make sure to install it before proceeding.

The project can also be run manually. To do so, first download the project and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zbejas/orbiscast
cd orbiscast
bun install
```

Setup the enviroment variables and start the bot by running:

```bash
bun run start
```

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables, which should be defined in a `.env` file (see `.env.example`):

### System and IPTV Configuration

| Variable           | Description                                      | Example/Default                          | Required |

> [!TIP]
> There is a bunch of IPTV providers online. I recommend using a tool like [Threadfin](https://github.com/Threadfin/Threadfin) or [Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) to sort out your IPTV channels. You can find public M3U playlists [here](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv). More info on IPTV can be found [here](https://github.com/iptv-org/awesome-iptv).

### Discord Configuration

The reason we have a `bot` and a `user` token is because the current Discord API does not allow bots to stream video. The bot is used to control the user, which is the one that actually streams the video.

| Variable              | Description                                      | Example/Default                          | Required |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`           | Token for the Discord bot.                       | `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE`                    | ✔        |
| `DISCORD_USER_TOKEN`  | Token for the Discord user.                      | `YOUR_USER_TOKEN_HERE`                   | ✔        |
| `GUILD`               | Discord guild (server) ID.                       | `000000000000000000`                     | ✔        |

## Commands

The bot can be controlled using the following commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/stream <channe>` | Start streaming the specified channel. |
| `/programme <channel>` | Show the current programme for the specified channel. |
| `/channels <page>` | List all available channels. Page is optional. |
| `/stop` | Stop the current stream. |
| `/refresh <type>` | Refresh the specified data. Type can be "all", "channels", or "programme". |

> [!TIP]
> Both `/channels` and `/programme` commands support autocompletion for channel names. However, Discord limits the number of options shown at once to 25. Use the `/channels` or `/programme` command to see all available channels. The bot will show the first 25 channels, and you can use the `page` argument to see more.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, here are some common problems and their solutions:

- **Stream freezes or hangs**: If the stream source gets disconnected or the stream is killed from the source side, the bot may hang indefinitely. Currently, there's no automatic detection for this issue, so you'll need to restart the bot.

- **Stream quality issues**: If you're experiencing quality problems, try adjusting the `BITRATE_VIDEO` and `BITRATE_VIDEO_MAX` environment variables to values that work better with your network conditions.

- **High latency**: Enable the `MINIMIZE_LATENCY` option in your environment variables to reduce streaming delay.

- **Missing channels**: Make sure your M3U playlist URL is correct and accessible. You can use the `/refresh channels` command to reload the channel list.

- **Authorization errors**: If the bot can't join voice channels or execute commands, verify that both the bot and user tokens are correct and have the necessary permissions.

If you encounter issues not listed here, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/zbejas/orbiscast/issues) with details about your problem.
  
> [!NOTE]
> In my testing, I've been using tools mentioned in the [System and IPTV Configuration](#system-and-iptv-configuration) tip to sort out the channels. It should work with any M3U or HDHR playlist, but I cannot guarantee it. This tool was not built or tested with a large number of channels, so it may not work as expected if you overload it with data. For any issues, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/zbejas/orbiscast/issues).
